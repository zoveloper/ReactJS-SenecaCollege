  1. Script Tags ===============================================================
  To write JavaScript in an HTML page create a script tag. Any code which is
  inside of the opening and closing script tags will be read as JavaScript
  code.

  Because script tags are classified as both meta content and flow content
  they can be placed in either the head tag or the body tag. Any JavaScript code
  which should run before your HTML page loads should be placed in the head
  tag.

<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Intro to JavaScript</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>Press F12 in Chrome or FireFox to open Developer Console</p>
    <p>Mac Shortkeys: Command + Option + J</p>
    <p>Windows Shortkeys: Control + Shift + J</p>
  </main>

  <!--
  Most of the time you would want to put your script tags at the bottom of the
  page just before the closing body tag. There are multiple reasons for this.

  Much of the time you will want to use JavaScript to alter your HTML or CSS.
  HTML pages are read from top to bottom. You would want all of your HTML and
  CSS to load before you try to alter it using JavaScript. If you did not do
  this then the JavaScript may run before the HTML elements have loaded and many
  JavaScript events may never be applied to them.

  Another reason to place your script tags at the bottom of the page is that
  if JavaScript is placed in the head tag of your page then the HTML can not
  load until the JS has loaded. Placing your JS at the bottom of the page
  will increase the loading speed of your site and will also increase your
  SEO ranking as a result.
