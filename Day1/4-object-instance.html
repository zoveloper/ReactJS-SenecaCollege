1. Creating Objects ========================================================
To create a new object, use the new keyword followed by the Object keyword.
We will create an object to represent a cup of coffee.
*/ let myCoffee = new Object();
      /*
2. Properties ==============================================================
Properties represent data which is associated with and related to a specific
object.
They are saved as variables which are attached to the end of an object name
and are separated from it with a dot. The use of the dot to access object
properties is known as dot notation.
*/ myCoffee.size = "Small";
      myCoffee.creams = 1;
      myCoffee.sugars = 1;
      myCoffee.customer = "Jaya";
      /*
Properties are used the same way that variables are except they can only be
accessed through the variable name of the object which they are associatied
with using dot notation.
*/ alert(myCoffee.size);
      /*
3. Methods =================================================================
Objects can also perform actions which are represented by functions that are
attached to end of an object name and which are called methods.
Methods are actually defined as properties of an object which hold anonymous
functions. Therefore every method is also a property. Like normal properties methods are
defined through the name of the object which they are associated with
using dot notation.

            myCoffee.customer +
            "!"

To call a method of an object use the variable name of the object and then
the name of the method including parentheses using dot notation.
